Project: omniauth-identity — Development Guidelines (for advanced contributors)

This document captures project-specific knowledge to streamline setup, testing, and ongoing development.

1. Build and configuration
- ENV is controlled by `direnv`.
  - Two files are loaded:
    - .envrc — environment variables for local development, committed to source control
    - .env.local — environment variables that are not committed to source control. These setting override .envrc.
  - Run `direnv allow` after making changes to .envrc or .env.local.
    - See .envrc for details.
    - See .env.local.example for an example of what to put in .env.local.
    - See CONTRIBUTING.md for details on how to set up your local environment.
- Ruby and Bundler
  - Runtime supports Ruby >= 2.4
  - Development tooling targets Ruby >= 2.4 (minimum supported by setup-ruby GHA).
  - Use a recent Ruby (>= 3.4 recommended) for fastest setup and to exercise modern coverage behavior.
  - Install dependencies via Bundler in project root:
    - bundle install
- Rake tasks (preferred entry points)
  - The Rakefile wires common workflows. Useful targets:
    - rake spec — run RSpec suite (also aliased via rake test)
    - rake coverage — run specs with coverage locally and open a report (requires kettle-soup-cover)
    - rake rubocop_gradual:autocorrect — RuboCop-LTS Gradual, with autocorrect as default task
    - rake reek and rake reek:update — code smell checks and persisted snapshots in REEK
    - rake yard — generate YARD docs for lib and selected extra files
    - rake bundle:audit and rake bundle:audit:update — dependency vulnerability checks
    - rake build / rake release — gem build/release helper tasks (Bundler + stone_checksums)
  - The default rake target runs a curated set of tasks; this varies for CI vs local (see CI env var logic in Rakefile).
    - Always run the default rake task prior commits, and after making changes to lib/ code, or *.md files, to allow the linter to autocorrect, and to generate updated documentation.
- Coverage orchestration
  - Coverage is controlled by kettle-soup-cover and .simplecov. Thresholds (line and branch) are enforced and can fail the process.
  - Thresholds are primarily controlled by environment variables (see .simplecov and comments therein) typically loaded via direnv (.envrc) and CI workflow (.github/workflows/coverage.yml). When running only a test subset, thresholds may fail; see Testing below.
- Gem signing (for releases)
  - Signing is enabled unless SKIP_GEM_SIGNING is set. If enabled and certificates are present (certs/<USER>.pem), gem build will attempt to sign using ~/.ssh/gem-private_key.pem.
  - See CONTRIBUTING.md for releasing details; use SKIP_GEM_SIGNING when building in environments without the private key.
  - Important for local testing (to avoid hanging prompts): ALWAYS skip signing when building locally to test the packaging or install process. Without the private key password, the build will wait indefinitely at a signing prompt.
    - One-off commands (recommended):
      - SKIP_GEM_SIGNING=true gem build omniauth-identity.gemspec
      - SKIP_GEM_SIGNING=true bundle exec rake build
      - SKIP_GEM_SIGNING=true bundle exec rake release  # only to test workflow; do not actually push
    - direnv option (optional, not recommended globally): add `export SKIP_GEM_SIGNING=true` to your .env.local when you know you won’t be signing in this environment.
    - Remove or unset SKIP_GEM_SIGNING when performing a real, signed release in the environment that has the private key.

2. Testing
- Framework and helpers
  - RSpec 3.13 with custom spec/spec_helper.rb configuration:
    - silent_stream: STDOUT is silenced by default for examples to keep logs clean.
      - To explicitly test console output, tag the example or group with :check_output.
    - Global state hygiene: Around each example, FlossFunding.namespaces and FlossFunding.silenced are snapshotted and restored to prevent cross-test pollution.
    - DEBUG toggle: Set DEBUG=true to require 'debug' and avoid silencing output during your run.
    - ENV seeding: The suite sets ENV["FLOSS_FUNDING_FLOSS_FUNDING"] = "Free-as-in-beer" so that the library’s own namespace is considered activated (avoids noisy warnings).
    - Coverage: kettle-soup-cover integrates SimpleCov; .simplecov is invoked from spec_helper when enabled by Kettle::Soup::Cover::DO_COV, which is controlled by K_SOUP_COV_DO being set to true / false.
    - RSpec.describe usage:
      - Use `describe "#<method_name>"` to contain a block of specs that test instance method behavior.
      - Use `describe "::<method_name>"` to contain a block of specs that test class method behavior.
      - Do not use `describe ".<method_name>"` because the dot is ambiguous w.r.t instance vs. class methods.
    - When adding new code or modifying existing code always add tests to cover the updated behavior, including branches, and different types of expected and unexpected inputs.
  - Additional test utilities:
    - rspec-stubbed_env: Use stub_env to control ENV safely within examples.
    - timecop-rspec: Time manipulation is available, and is setup by kettle-test.
      - To freeze time use `freeze: Time.new(*args)` tag on an example or group
- Running tests (verified)
  - Full suite (recommended to satisfy coverage thresholds):
    - bin/rspec
    - or: bundle exec rspec
    - or: bundle exec rake spec
  - Progress format (less verbose):
    - bundle exec rspec --format progress
  - Focused runs
    - You can run a single file or example, but note: coverage thresholds need to be disabled with K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD=false
    - Example: K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD=false bin/rspec spec/omniauth-identity/class_spec.rb:42
  - Output visibility
    - To see STDOUT from the code under test, use the :check_output tag on the example or group.
      Example:
      RSpec.describe "output", :check_output do
        it "prints" do
          puts "This output should be visible"
          expect(true).to be true
        end
      end
    - Alternatively, run with DEBUG=true to disable silencing for the entire run.
  - During a spec run, the presence of output about missing activation keys is often expected, since it is literally what this library is for. It only indicates a failure if the spec expected all activation keys to be present, and not all specs do.
- Adding new tests (guidelines)
  - Organize specs by class/module. Do not create per-task umbrella spec files; add examples to the existing spec for the class/module under test, or create a new spec file for that class/module if one does not exist. Only create a standalone scenario spec when it intentionally spans multiple classes for an integration/benchmark scenario (e.g., bench_integration_spec), and name it accordingly.
  - Spec file names must map to a real class or module under lib/ (mirror the path). Do not introduce specs for non-existent classes or ad-hoc names (e.g., avoid template_helpers_replacements_spec.rb when testing Omniauth::Identity::TemplateHelpers; add those examples to template_helpers_spec.rb).
  - REQUIRED: Provide unit tests for every class, module, constant, and public method. Place them in spec/ mirroring the path under lib/. When a file under lib/ is added or changed, ensure a corresponding spec file exists/updated for it.
  - Add tests for all public methods and add contexts for variations of their arguments, and arity.
  - This repository targets near-100% coverage of its public API; when you add new public methods, rake tasks to a rakelib, or config behavior, add or update specs accordingly.
  - Place new specs under spec/ mirroring lib/ structure where possible. Do not require "spec_helper" at the top of spec files, as it is automatically loaded by .rspec.
  - If your code relies on environment variables that drive activation (see "Activation env vars" below), prefer using rspec-stubbed_env:
    - it does not support stubbing with blocks, but it does automatically clean up after itself.
    - the below config is included in all spec scenarios by the kettle-test gem, so no need to do it again; it is here for reference:
      include_context 'with stubbed env'
    - in a before hook, or in an example:
      stub_env("FLOSS_FUNDING_MY_NS" => "Free-as-in-beer")

      # example code continues

  - If your spec needs to assert on console output, tag it with :check_output. By default, STDOUT is silenced.
  - Use Timecop for deterministic time-sensitive behavior as needed (require config/timecop is already done by spec_helper).

- Types and documentation
  - REQUIRED: All public APIs must have RBS type signatures checked into sig/ under the corresponding path. When you add a new public method or change a signature, update the matching .rbs file.
  - REQUIRED: All public methods must include inline YARD docs with @param/@return (and @yield/@option where applicable). Generate docs with `bundle exec rake yard` to verify formatting.

3. Additional development information
- Code style and static analysis
  - RuboCop-LTS (Gradual) is integrated. Use:
    - bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:autocorrect
    - bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:force_update # only run if there are still linting violations the default rake task, which includes autocorrect locally, or a standalone autocorrect task, has run, and failed, and the violations won't be fixed
  - Reek is configured to scan {lib,spec,tests}/**/*.rb. Use:
    - bundle exec rake reek
    - bundle exec rake reek:update              # writes current output to REEK, fails on smells
    - Keep REEK file updated with intentional smells snapshot when appropriate (e.g., after refactors).
    - Locally, the default rake task includes reek:update.
- Documentation
  - Generate YARD docs with: bundle exec rake yard. It includes lib/**/*.rb and extra docs like README.md, CHANGELOG.md, RUBOCOP.md, REEK, etc.
- Appraisal and multi-gemfile testing
  - appraisal2 is present to manage multiple dependency sets; see Appraisals and gemfiles/modular/*.gemfile. If you need to verify against alternate dependency versions, use Appraisal to install and run rspec under those Gemfiles.
  - You can run a single github workflow by running `act -W /github/workflows/<workflow name>.yml`
- CI/local differences and defaults
  - The Rakefile adjusts default tasks based on CI env var. Locally, rake default may include coverage, reek:update, yard, etc. On CI, it tends to just run spec.

Quick start
1) bundle install
2) K_SOUP_COV_FORMATTERS="json" bin/rspec (generates a JSON coverage report with both line and branch data in coverage/. Use this single format.)
3) Static analysis: bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:check && bundle exec rake reek

Notes
- ALWAYS Run bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:autocorrect as the final step before completing a task, to lint and autocorrect any remaining issues. Then if there are new lint failures, attempt to correct them manually.
- NEVER run vanilla rubocop, as it won't handle the linting config properly. Always run rubocop_gradual:autocorrect or rubocop_gradual.
- Running only a subset of specs is supported but in order to bypass the hard failure due to coverage thresholds, you need to run with K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD=false.
- When adding code that writes to STDOUT, remember most specs silence output unless tagged with :check_output or DEBUG=true.
- Completion criteria after changes: Only consider your change “done” when the relevant examples pass, as verified by .rspec_status. Do not rely on STDOUT impressions; consult .rspec_status (and example IDs) to confirm green results for the affected files/examples. If you ran a subset, re-run the full suite before finalizing to restore coverage thresholds.
- Coverage reports: NEVER review the HTML report. Use JSON (preferred), XML, LCOV, or RCOV. For this project, always run tests with K_SOUP_COV_FORMATTERS set to "json".
- Do NOT modify .envrc in tasks; when running tests locally or in scripts, manually prefix each run, e.g.: K_SOUP_COV_FORMATTERS="json" bin/rspec
- For all the kettle-soup-cover options, see .envrc and find the K_SOUP_COV_* env vars.
- NEVER modify ENV variables in tests directly. Always use the stub_env macro from the rspec-stubbed_env gem (more details in the testing section above).

Important documentation rules
- Do NOT edit files under docs/ manually; they are generated by `bundle exec rake yard` as part of the default rake task.
- Clarification: Executable scripts provided by this gem (exe/* and installed binstubs) work when the gem is installed as a system gem (gem install omniauth-identity). However, the Rake tasks provided by this gem require omniauth-identity to be declared as a development dependency in the host project's Gemfile and loaded in the project's Rakefile.
