# 🤑 Request for Help

Maintainers have teeth and need to pay their dentists.
After getting laid off in an RIF in March and filled with many dozens of rejections,
I'm now spending ~60+ hours a week building open source tools.
I'm hoping to be able to pay for my kids' health insurance this month,
so if you value the work I am doing, I need your support.
Please consider sponsoring me or the project.

# Another Way to Support Open Source Software

> How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.<br/>
>—Anne Frank

I’m driven by a passion to foster a thriving open-source community – a space where people can tackle complex problems, no matter how small.  Revitalizing libraries that have fallen into disrepair, and building new libraries focused on solving real-world challenges, are my passions — totaling 79 hours of FLOSS coding over just the past seven days, a pretty regular week for me.  I was recently affected by layoffs, and the tech jobs market is unwelcoming. I’m reaching out here because your support would significantly aid my efforts to provide for my family, and my farm (11 🐔 chickens, 2 🐶 dogs, 3 🐰 rabbits, 8 🐈‍ cats).

If you work at a company that uses my work, please encourage them to support me as a corporate sponsor. My work on gems you use might show up in `bundle fund`.

I’m developing a new library, [floss_funding][🖇floss-funding-gem], designed to empower open-source developers like myself to get paid for the work we do, in a sustainable way. Please give it a look.

**[Floss-Funding.dev][🖇floss-funding.dev]: 👉️ No network calls. 👉️ No tracking. 👉️ No oversight. 👉️ Minimal crypto hashing. 💡 Easily disabled nags**
