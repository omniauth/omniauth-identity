# Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on [CodeBerg][üìúsrc-cb], [GitLab][üìúsrc-gl], or [GitHub][üìúsrc-gh].
This project should be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, so contributors agree to adhere to
the [code of conduct][ü§ùconduct].

To submit a patch, please fork the project, create a patch with tests, and send a pull request.

Remember to [![Keep A Changelog][üìókeep-changelog-img]][üìókeep-changelog] if you make changes.

## Help out!

Take a look at the `reek` list which is the file called `REEK` and find something to improve.

Follow these instructions:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Make some fixes.
4. Commit changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Make sure to add tests for it. This is important, so it doesn't break in a future release.
7. Create new Pull Request.

## Executables vs Rake tasks

Executables shipped by omniauth-identity can be used with or without generating the binstubs.
They will work when omniauth-identity is installed globally (i.e., `gem install omniauth-identity`) and do not require that omniauth-identity be in your bundle.

- kettle-changelog
- kettle-commit-msg
- omniauth-identity-setup
- kettle-dvcs
- kettle-pre-release
- kettle-readme-backers
- kettle-release

However, the rake tasks provided by omniauth-identity do require omniauth-identity to be added as a development dependency and loaded in your Rakefile.
See the full list of rake tasks in head of Rakefile

**Gemfile**
```ruby
group :development do
  gem "omniauth-identity", require: false
end
```

**Rakefile**
```ruby
# Rakefile
require "omniauth/identity"
```

## Environment Variables for Local Development

Below are the primary environment variables recognized by stone_checksums (and its integrated tools). Unless otherwise noted, set boolean values to the string "true" to enable.

General/runtime
- DEBUG: Enable extra internal logging for this library (default: false)
- REQUIRE_BENCH: Enable `require_bench` to profile requires (default: false)
- CI: When set to true, adjusts default rake tasks toward CI behavior

Coverage (kettle-soup-cover / SimpleCov)
- K_SOUP_COV_DO: Enable coverage collection (default: true in .envrc)
- K_SOUP_COV_FORMATTERS: Comma-separated list of formatters (html, xml, rcov, lcov, json, tty)
- K_SOUP_COV_MIN_LINE: Minimum line coverage threshold (integer, e.g., 100)
- K_SOUP_COV_MIN_BRANCH: Minimum branch coverage threshold (integer, e.g., 100)
- K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD: Fail the run if thresholds are not met (true/false)
- K_SOUP_COV_MULTI_FORMATTERS: Enable multiple formatters at once (true/false)
- K_SOUP_COV_OPEN_BIN: Path to browser opener for HTML (empty disables auto-open)
- MAX_ROWS: Limit console output rows for simplecov-console (e.g., 1)
  Tip: When running a single spec file locally, you may want `K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD=false` to avoid failing thresholds for a partial run.

GitHub API and CI helpers
- GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN: Token used by `ci:act` and release workflow checks to query GitHub Actions status at higher rate limits

Releasing and signing
- SKIP_GEM_SIGNING: If set, skip gem signing during build/release
- GEM_CERT_USER: Username for selecting your public cert in `certs/<USER>.pem` (defaults to $USER)
- SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH: Reproducible build timestamp. `kettle-release` will set this automatically for the session.

Git hooks and commit message helpers (exe/kettle-commit-msg)
- GIT_HOOK_BRANCH_VALIDATE: Branch name validation mode (e.g., `jira`) or `false` to disable
- GIT_HOOK_FOOTER_APPEND: Append a footer to commit messages when goalie allows (true/false)
- GIT_HOOK_FOOTER_SENTINEL: Required when footer append is enabled ‚Äî a unique first-line sentinel to prevent duplicates
- GIT_HOOK_FOOTER_APPEND_DEBUG: Extra debug output in the footer template (true/false)

For a quick starting point, this repository‚Äôs `.envrc` shows sane defaults, and `.env.local` can override them locally.

## Appraisals

From time to time the [appraisal2][üöéappraisal2] gemfiles in `gemfiles/` will need to be updated.
They are created and updated with the commands:

```console
bin/rake appraisal:update
```

When adding an appraisal to CI, check the [runner tool cache][üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èrunner-tool-cache] to see which runner to use.

## The Reek List

Take a look at the `reek` list which is the file called `REEK` and find something to improve.

To refresh the `reek` list:

```console
bundle exec reek > REEK
```

## Run Tests

NOTE: To run *all* tests have the following databases installed, configured, and running.

1. [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com), an open source, real-time, web database, [installed](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/) and [running](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/start-a-server/), e.g.
   ```console
   brew install rethinkdb
   rethinkdb
   ```
2. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
   ```console
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community@4.4
   mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
   ```
3. [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org) - download the .app, or:
   ```console
   brew install couchdb
   ```
   CouchDB 3.x requires a set admin password set before startup.
   Add one to your `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/local.ini` before starting CouchDB e.g.:
   ```ini
   [admins]
   admin = yourabsolutesecret
   ```
   Also add whatever password you set to your `.env.local`:
   ```dotenv
   export COUCHDB_PASSWORD=yourabsolutesecret
   ```
   Then start the CouchDB service
   ```console
   brew services start couchdb
   ```

Now you can run any of the tests!

To run all tests on all databases (except RethinkDB):
```console
bundle exec rake spec:orm:all
```

To run all tests that do not require any additional services, i.e. excluding MongoDB, CouchDB, & RethinkDB:
```console
bundle exec rake test
```

To run a specific DB:
```console
# CouchDB / CouchPotato
bundle exec rspec spec spec_orms --tag 'couchdb'

# ActiveRecord and Sequel, as they both use the in-memory SQLite driver.
bundle exec rspec spec spec_orms --tag 'sqlite3'

# NOTE - mongoid and nobrainer specs can't be isolated with "tag" because it still loads everything,
#        and the two libraries are fundamentally incompatible.

# MongoDB / Mongoid
bundle exec rspec spec_orms/mongoid_spec.rb

# RethinkDB / NoBrainer (Ignored by CI! see spec file for reasons)
bundle exec rspec spec_ignored/nobrainer_spec.rb
```

### Spec organization (required)

- One spec file per class/module. For each class or module under `lib/`, keep all of its unit tests in a single spec file under `spec/` that mirrors the path and file name exactly: `lib/omniauth/identity/*.rb` -> `spec/omniauth/identity/*_spec.rb`.
- Never add a second spec file for the same class/module. Examples of disallowed names: `*_more_spec.rb`, `*_extra_spec.rb`, `*_status_spec.rb`, or any other suffix that still targets the same class. If you find yourself wanting a second file, merge those examples into the canonical spec file for that class/module.
- Exception: Integration specs that intentionally span multiple classes. Place these under `spec/integration/` (or a clearly named integration folder), and do not directly mirror a single class. Name them after the scenario, not a class.
- Migration note: If a duplicate spec file exists, move all examples into the canonical file and delete the duplicate. Do not leave stubs or empty files behind.

## Lint It

Run all the default tasks, which includes running the gradually autocorrecting linter, `rubocop-gradual`.

```console
bundle exec rake
```

Or just run the linter.

```console
bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:autocorrect
```

For more detailed information about using RuboCop in this project, please see the [RUBOCOP.md](RUBOCOP.md) guide. This project uses `rubocop_gradual` instead of vanilla RuboCop, which requires specific commands for checking violations.

### Important: Do not add inline RuboCop disables

Never add `# rubocop:disable ...` / `# rubocop:enable ...` comments to code or specs (except when following the few existing `rubocop:disable` patterns for a rule already being disabled elsewhere in the code). Instead:

- Prefer configuration-based exclusions when a rule should not apply to certain paths or files (e.g., via `.rubocop.yml`).
- When a violation is temporary and you plan to fix it later, record it in `.rubocop_gradual.lock` using the gradual workflow:
  - `bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:autocorrect` (preferred)
  - `bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:force_update` (only when you cannot fix the violations immediately)

As a general rule, fix style issues rather than ignoring them. For example, our specs should follow RSpec conventions like using `described_class` for the class under test.

## For Maintainers

### One-time, Per-maintainer, Setup

**IMPORTANT**: To sign a build,
a public key for signing gems will need to be picked up by the line in the
`gemspec` defining the `spec.cert_chain` (check the relevant ENV variables there).
All releases are signed releases.
See: [RubyGems Security Guide][üîíÔ∏èrubygems-security-guide]

NOTE: To build without signing the gem set `SKIP_GEM_SIGNING` to any value in the environment.

### To release a new version:

#### Automated process

1. Update version.rb to contain the correct version-to-be-released.
2. Run `bundle exec kettle-changelog`.
3. Run `bundle exec kettle-release`.

#### Manual process

1. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` as a "test, coverage, & linting" sanity check
2. Update the version number in `version.rb`, and ensure `CHANGELOG.md` reflects changes
3. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` again as a secondary check, and to update `Gemfile.lock`
4. Run `git commit -am "üîñ Prepare release v<VERSION>"` to commit the changes
5. Run `git push` to trigger the final CI pipeline before release, and merge PRs
    - NOTE: Remember to [check the build][üß™build].
6. Run `export GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME="$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d ' ' -f5)" && echo $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
7. Run `git checkout $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
8. Run `git pull origin $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME` to ensure latest trunk code
9. Optional for older Bundler (< 2.7.0): Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` so `rake build` and `rake release` use the same timestamp and generate the same checksums
    - If your Bundler is >= 2.7.0, you can skip this; builds are reproducible by default.
    - Run `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$EPOCHSECONDS && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
    - If the echo above has no output, then it didn't work.
    - Note: `zsh/datetime` module is needed, if running `zsh`.
    - In older versions of `bash` you can use `date +%s` instead, i.e. `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date +%s) && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
10. Run `bundle exec rake build`
11. Run `bin/gem_checksums` (more context [1][üîíÔ∏èrubygems-checksums-pr], [2][üîíÔ∏èrubygems-guides-pr])
    to create SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksums. This functionality is provided by the `stone_checksums`
    [gem][üíéstone_checksums].
    - The script automatically commits but does not push the checksums
12. Sanity check the SHA256, comparing with the output from the `bin/gem_checksums` command:
    - `sha256sum pkg/<gem name>-<version>.gem`
13. Run `bundle exec rake release` which will create a git tag for the version,
    push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to the gem host configured in the gemspec.
