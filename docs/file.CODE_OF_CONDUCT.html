<h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>

<p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our<br>
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body<br>
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender<br>
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,<br>
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual<br>
identity and orientation.</p>

<p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,<br>
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>

<h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>

<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our<br>
community include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li>
  <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
  <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
  <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,<br>
and learning from the experience</li>
  <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall<br>
community</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of<br>
any kind</li>
  <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>

  <li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address,<br>
without their explicit permission</li>
  <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a<br>
professional setting</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enforcement-responsibilities">Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of<br>
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in<br>
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,<br>
or harmful.</p>

<p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject<br>
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are<br>
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation<br>
decisions when appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when<br>
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.<br>
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,<br>
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed<br>
representative at an online or offline event.</p>

<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be<br>
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at<br>
<a href="http://www.railsbling.com/contact"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Contact-Maintainer-0093D0.svg?style=flat&amp;logo=rubyonrails&amp;logoColor=red" alt="Contact Maintainer"></a>.<br>
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.</p>

<p>All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the<br>
reporter of any incident.</p>

<h2 id="enforcement-guidelines">Enforcement Guidelines</h2>

<p>Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining<br>
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:</p>

<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed<br>
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.</p>

<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A violation through a single incident or series of<br>
actions.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No<br>

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.</p>
