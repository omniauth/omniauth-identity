# To retain chunks of comments & code during omniauth-identity templating:
# Wrap custom sections with freeze markers (e.g., as above and below this comment chunk).
# omniauth-identity will then preserve content between those markers across template runs.

# If the values for minimum coverage need to change, they should be changed both there,
#   and in 2 places in .github/workflows/coverage.yml.
