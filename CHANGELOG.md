## [3.0.9] - 2021-06-16
- TAG: [v3.0.9][3.0.9t]
### Fixed
- \[Sequel\] Fixes loading the Sequel adapter, issue reported as [#112](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-identity/issues/112)
### Added
- 📝 Document the Database adapters and drivers the gem currently works with

## [3.0.8] - 2021-03-24
- TAG: [v3.0.8][3.0.8t]
### Fixed
- \[Model\] Fixes 2 issues raised in a comment on PR [#108](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-identity/pull/108#issuecomment-804456604)
  - When `options[:on_validation]` is set `new`/`save`/`persisted?` logic is used.
  - When `options[:on_validation]` is not set `create`/`persisted?` logic is used.

## [3.0.7] - 2021-03-23
- TAG: [v3.0.7][3.0.7t]
### Fixed
- \[ActiveRecord\] Fixed [#110](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-identity/issues/110) which prevented `OmniAuth::Identity::Models::ActiveRecord`-based records from saving.
- \[CouchPotato\] Fixed `OmniAuth::Identity::Models::CouchPotato`'s `#save`.
- \[Sequel\] Fixed `OmniAuth::Identity::Models::Sequel`'s `#save`.
- \[Model\] Only define `::create`, `#save`, and `#persisted?` when not already defined.
- \[Model\] Restore original `info` functionality which set `name` based on `first_name`, `last_name`, or `nickname`
### Changed
- Upgraded to a newer `OmniAuth::Identity::SecurePassword` ripped from [Rails 6-1-stable](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6-1-stable/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb)
  - Aeons ago the original was ripped from Rails 3.1, and frozen in time.
    While writing specs, it was discovered to be incompatible with this gem's Sequel adapter.
  - Specs validate that the new version does work.
    In any case, the ripped version is only used when the `has_secure_password` macro is not yet defined in the class.
### Added
- New specs to cover real use cases and implementations of each ORM model adapter that ships with the gem:
  - ActiveRecord (Polyglot - Many Relational Databases)
  - Sequel (Polyglot - Many Relational Databases)
  - CouchPotato (CouchDB)
  - Mongoid (MongoDB)
  - NoBrainer (RethinkDB)

## [3.0.6] - 2021-03-20
- TAG: [v3.0.6][3.0.6t]
### Fixed
- Fix breaking changes introduced by [#108](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-identity/pull/108) which prevented `:on_validation` from firing
### Added
- New (or finally documented) options:
  - `:create_identity_link_text` defaults to `'Create an Identity'`
  - `:registration_failure_message` defaults to `'One or more fields were invalid'`
  - `:validation_failure_message` defaults to `'Validation failed'`
  - `:title` defaults to `'Identity Verification'`
  - `:registration_form_title` defaults to `'Register Identity'`

## [3.0.5] - 2021-03-19
- TAG: [v3.0.5][3.0.5t]
### Fixed
- Fix breaking changes introduced by [#86's](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-identity/pull/86) introduction of `:on_validation`
